# BLengua

## Description:
Used as a personal project to test yourself on a video you've recently watched. It creates snippets of the video based upon the captions and replays snippets of clips to test your quickfire knowledge in a language. I reccommend using videos like EasyGreek or EasyGerman but these captions usually aren't that great at matching with videos.

## Features:
- Python Based

## Setup:
(Make sure to download all of the requirement libraries in "requirements.txt")
- Download a .mp4 copy of your desired video, name it "main.mp4" and place it in video_snippets
- Change video_id parameter to the VideoID of the YouTube video so the program can download the subtitles
- (Alternative): download the captions in a json format and place it in "local_copy.txt"
- Change the parameters in the python file to your liking (but make sure to change the language/s)
- When running:
  - Click enter after the question_msg has appeared
  - Either choose 1: Next Card or other: Repeat Video

## Uses:
This software is unlicensed so use as you wish. I would like credit but it's up to you. 
The code has been <sub><sup>attempted</sup></sub> to be made as modular as possible.
